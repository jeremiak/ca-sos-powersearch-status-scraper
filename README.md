# How often is [PowerSearch](https://powersearch.sos.ca.gov:3000/) down?

I'm not sure, this scraper is an attempt to figure that out. I'm using Github actions to get the HTTP status code from https://powersearch.sos.ca.gov:3000/.

## What is PowerSearch?
It's the California Secretary of State's advanced search tool for campaign finance data. It's OK, but the larger problem is that its just not available a lot.
